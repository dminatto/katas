# 3 Sum

## Description

The 3Sum kata is a coding challenge that involves finding all unique triplets in an array that sum up to a given target value. Given an array of integers, the task is to find all unique triplets that satisfy the condition: a + b + c = target, where a, b, and c are elements from the array.

This problem challenges your ability to manipulate arrays, handle different data structures, and efficiently solve the problem with optimal time complexity.

## Problem Statement

Given an array `nums` of n integers, find all unique triplets in the array that sum up to a target value `target`.

### Example

Input: `nums = [-1, 0, 1, 2, -1, -4], target = 0`

Output: `[[-1, 0, 1],[-1, -1, 2]]`

**Note:** The solution set must not contain duplicate triplets.

## Constraints

- `-10^5 <= nums[i] <= 10^5`: The range of integer values in the input array.
- `0 <= nums.length <= 3000`: The number of elements in the input array.
- `-10^5 <= target <= 10^5`: The target sum value.
