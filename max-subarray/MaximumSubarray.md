# Maximum SubArray

This repository contains my solution for the "Maximum SubArray" kata. The Maximum SubArray problem is a classic algorithmic challenge where the goal is to find the contiguous subarray within a given array of integers that has the largest sum.

## Problem description

Given an array of integers, we need to find the subarray (contiguous elements) with the largest sum and return the sum itself. The subarray must consist of at least one element.

For example, given the input array:

    [-2, 1, -3, 4, -1, 2, 1, -5, 4]

The solution should return the maximum sum, which is **6**, corresponding to the subarray `[4, -1, 2, 1]`.
