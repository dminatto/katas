## Problem Description

Given an array `prices` where `prices[i]` is the price of a given stock on day `i`, the task is to find the maximum profit that can be achieved by buying and selling a stock at most once.

### Example 1:
    Input: prices = [7,1,5,3,6,4]
    Output: 5
    Explanation: Buy on day 2 (price = 1) and sell on day 5 (price = 6), profit = 6-1 = 5.
    Note that buying on day 2 and selling on day 1 is not allowed because you must buy before you sell.


### Example 2:
    Input: prices = [7,6,4,3,1]
    Output: 0
    Explanation: In this case, no transactions are done and the max profit = 0.
