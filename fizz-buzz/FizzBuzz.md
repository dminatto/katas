# FizzBuzz

The FizzBuzz problem is a classic coding challenge often used in programming interviews and as an exercise to practice problem-solving and coding skills. The problem is simple, yet it can reveal a candidate's ability to write clean and efficient code.

## Problem Statement

Write a program that prints the numbers from 1 to **n**, where **n** is an input integer. But for multiples of 3, print `Fizz` instead of the number, and for multiples of 5, print `Buzz` instead of the number. 
For numbers that are multiples of both 3 and 5, print `FizzBuzz`.

Here's how the output should look like for the first **n** numbers:

    1
    2
    Fizz
    4
    Buzz
    Fizz
    7
    8
    Fizz
    Buzz
    11
    Fizz
    13
    14
    FizzBuzz
    16

You can approach the FizzBuzz problem using any programming language of your choice. The goal is to demonstrate your understanding of basic control structures and modulo arithmetic.

Have fun solving it and happy coding!
